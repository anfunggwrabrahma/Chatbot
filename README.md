# IOCL Chatbot (Automating Link Discovery: Developing a Chatbot for Website Navigation)

Welcome to the IOCL Chatbot repository! In this project, we have developed a chatbot specifically tailored for IOCL (Indian Oil Corporation Limited) organization. The chatbot is designed to assist users with accessing information and resources related to IOCL's services, products, and other relevant topics.

- **CSS**: Employed for styling and enhancing the visual presentation of the chatbot.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the interactive behavior and functionality of the chatbot.
- **JSON**: Data format used for storing and managing extracted information from the IOCL website.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Python library utilized for web scraping to gather links and data from the IOCL website.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can interact with the chatbot through a user-friendly interface.
- **Link Extraction**: The chatbot extracts relevant links from the IOCL website to provide users with accurate information.
- **Real-time Responses**: The chatbot provides real-time responses to user queries based on the extracted data.
- **Customizable**: The chatbot can be easily customized and extended to incorporate additional features or functionalities and this method can be applied to different websites for fetching links or other important informations.
- **Simplicity**: This chatbot is easy to implement and is designed for quick and fast response.
